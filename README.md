## üõ†Ô∏è Node Inputs

| Input       | Description                                                                                                              |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `image`     | The generated image to upload (connect from a `VAEDecode` node). Supports single image or list of images for animation.  |
| `video`     | (Optional) A video file to upload as browser-compatible MP4. Takes precedence over `image` if provided.                  |
| `fps`       | (Optional) Frame rate for animated WebP output (applies when uploading multiple images as animation).                    |
| `lossless`  | (Optional) Whether to save the animated WebP in lossless mode.                                                           |
| `quality`   | (Optional) Quality setting for animated WebP (0‚Äì100).                                                                    |
| `method`    | (Optional) Encoding method for animated WebP (`default`, `fastest`, or `slowest`).                                       |
| `api_key`   | Your personal BASE API key (see above).                                                                                  |
| `folder_id` | (Optional) The ID of a folder in your BASE account to store the image/video under. Right-click a folder in BASE to copy its ID. |

## üì¶ Node Behavior

This is an output node in ComfyUI. It performs an upload as a side effect and does not return any value to the graph.

- If `video` is provided, the node uploads a browser-compatible MP4 video to your BASE account.
- If `image` is a list of multiple frames, the node generates and uploads an animated WebP file.
- Otherwise, a static PNG image is uploaded.

---

## üí° Example Workflow

Place this node at the end of your workflow as an output node. Example use cases:

- **Static image upload:** Connect a single image (e.g., from `VAEDecode`) to `image` input to upload a PNG.
- **Animated image sequence:** Connect a list of images (frames) to `image` input and set `fps`/`quality`/`lossless`/`method` as desired to upload an animated WebP.
- **Video upload:** Connect a video file to the `video` input to upload it as an MP4.

Provide your BASE API key and (optionally) a folder ID. The node will upload the file to your BASE account as a side effect; it does not return any value to the graph.
